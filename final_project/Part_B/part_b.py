# Lazy evaluation is a technique where values are only computed when they are actually needed, rather than all at once.
# This can make programs more efficient by saving time and memory.
#
# Eager Evaluation:
# In the first part of the program, eager evaluation is used.
# Here, the function that generates values is called, and all the values are created and stored in a list immediately.
# This means the program runs through the entire sequence, generating all values at once, and then processes each value to compute its square.
# This approach can be inefficient if the dataset is large because it requires storing all the values in memory at once.
#
# Lazy Evaluation:
# In the second part of the program, lazy evaluation is demonstrated.
# Instead of generating all values at once, the program creates each value only when it is needed.
# The function that generates values is used directly in the list comprehension, so it produces one value at a time as the list comprehension processes each value to compute its square.
# This means the program doesnâ€™t need to store all the values in memory, making it more efficient.
